# Destiny Story
###### by /u/Sarcosmonaut

## PRE GAME
In the near future, humanity detects a strange presence in the solar system and sends astronauts to investigate. They encounter “The Traveler” on Mars, who is actively terraforming the planet. (The Traveler is a large white sphere, containing strange paracausal energies). Over the next few centuries, the traveler guides humanity into a Golden Age, terraforming multiple planets, sharing advanced technology, and generally improving life for everyone. However, eventually the enemies of the Traveler followed, destroying much of our system and our civilization before the Traveler drove them back into dark space. This battle severely damaged the Traveler, and it went mostly dormant. This event, which ended the Golden Age and killed the majority of our species, is referred to as The Collapse.

As it went dormant, it created “Ghosts”, the little mechanical drones that accompany your character and others like them. Those Ghosts sought and resurrected dead people from across the system and imbued them with paracausal energies/magic (called the Light) to protect itself and the people of the system. Ghosts also have the ability to continually bring back their chosen person from the dead, and this ability is key to what makes us so strong. Not ALL Risen are good guys, but the vast majority give it their best.

Over the next few centuries, humanity struggled to find shelter and safety as our system was beset by a variety of new enemies, and scavenged by ruthless species. The Risen fought enemies, and themselves, with leading factions emerging and crushing the evil ones for the most part. Over time our numbers dwindled even further, the survivors collecting themselves into a single large city underneath the sleeping Traveler. It is referred to as The Last City, and is probably somewhere in the Andes (though it doesn’t really matter). It is here that the Risen formally dubbed themselves Guardians, and do all they can to protect the city and what remains of humanity.

## DESTINY 1
Ghost finds you in the ruins of a Russian spaceport, and brings you back with no memory of who you were before (this is standard). He guides you through the spaceport infested with Fallen (a nomadic alien race of scavengers and pirates) to find a jump ship capable of escape. (An alternate version of these events play out in the current New Light campaign, where your guardian is raised and then meets another guardian who shows you the ropes. Canonically, your guardian is risen whenever you feel like they were, before the oldest event you played. But for the purposes of the write up I’m going from the perspective of a Day 1 veteran)

Once you do, you’re taken to the Tower (where guardians live in the Last City) and filled in on what’s going on, who the traveler is, why it’s important, what’s expected of you etc. Bottom line you’re a mostly immortal magic space warrior charged with the defense of humanity. But IF your ghost is destroyed, you lose your powers and are mortal once again.

The vanilla campaign for D1 is honestly pretty weak, and is mostly a tour of the system which introduces you to the enemy races and the Reef.

The Reef is a collection of settlements along the asteroid belt comprised of the Awoken. They are metahumans who look blue/purple and generally have much longer lives and health than humans. Their origins will be discussed later. They are ruled by Queen Mara Sov, an aloof leader with many plots, and her brother Prince Uldren Sov (honestly he’s a dickhead, but slavishly devoted to Mara). They are not hostile to Earth, but are generally standoffish. They help give us information on how to infiltrate the presumed home of one of the enemy races and defeat them there.

It focuses on the Vex, a race of time traveling hive mind radiolaria white goop. They pour themselves into mechanics bodies and drive them around, terraforming and converting everything they can into more Vex. With the help of the Reef and the Exo Stranger (a time traveling robot lady who has a history with the Vex), we infiltrate the Black Garden and destroy some ball of Darkness they were worshipping. (Dark is paracausal and opposed to the Light). Roll credits. The first raid is called Vault of Glass and doesn’t have anything to do with the story. It’s just you and a team disrupting Vex attempts to rewrite time.

### THE DARK BELOW
An old ghost less human guardian called Eris Morn (she has three eyes. More on that later) returns to the tower warning of the return of Crota, a prince of the Hive on the moon. The Hive are a three eyed alien race that is most closely aligned with the Darkness, as they worship it. They are driven to kill or they wither and die themselves. They become stronger by killing. It’s like magically enforced social Darwinism.

Anyways a long time ago, humanity attempted to retake the moon from the hive, and Crota stomped around like an unkillable war machine and brought final deaths to thousands of guardians in an event called the Great Disaster. Ever since, the moon has been off limits. You fight through the moon and disrupt the ritual meant to bring Crota to this plane of existence yet again… but he’s not dead yet. To kill a god of the Hive, as he is, you have to go to his plane and kill him THERE. And so you get raid number 2, Crota’s End. You cross into his plane (or Throne World) and kill him, ending his threat forever.

### HOUSE OF WOLVES
The Reef is in disarray as a loyal faction of Fallen has betrayed the queen and rallied around a new leader (or Kell) named Skolas. You work with the Queen’s people and a Fallen (or Eliksni, their name for themselves) scribe named Variks to track down Skolas and jail him before he rallies the rest of the Fallen Houses to his banner as the mythical Kell of Kells. We defeat and jail him, then execute him in ritual combat according to the old ways of the Eliksni as described by Variks.

### THE TAKEN KING
This is probably the most important event in the story of D1 by far. When you killed Crota, his death was sensed by his father Oryx, king of the Hive. He comes to our system seeking revenge and sustenance (because in the hive system of magic, your killing and power is tithed upwards. With Crota dead, Oryx is receiving less tribute). He arrives in a massive Dreadnought and faces off against the armada of the Reef. They get completely bodied by Oryx and his fleet, and his ship’s super weapon blows a hole in the belt of Jupiter still seem today. This battle does delay his fleet but also kills queen Mara Sov, and puts prince Uldren as MIA.

Oryx menaces the system from his ship, transforming many of our enemies into “Taken” with a magical ability he possesses. If you see an enemy that’s black and white and twitchy, looking like a field of stars? That’s a Taken. Basically he rips the consciousness out of a body, pours in a bunch of darkness, and turns them into a largely mindless drone. So we spend a lot of the expansion fighting the Taken and his shades and magical projections before managing to board his ship and disable his super weapon. From there we slowly gain the ability to traverse his magic portals by stealing his dead son’s essence (because only ascendant hive may tread there). We defeat him in our world, but he whisks himself away to his Throne World, ending the campaign. The raid, King’s Fall, has us traversing his ship and throne, battling his closest followers and finally killing Oryx himself, casting his corpse off into Jupiter (his throne world is inverted, and partially exists on our own plane). Lore suggests that one of his sisters takes up control of the Taken now with his passing.

### RISE OF IRON
Okay I loved this expansion but it basically doesn’t matter. Fallen splicers have discovered an ancient golden age technology called SIVA, which is basically programmable nano machine swarms. And they’ve used it to augment themselves and will eventually March on the city with it and tear it apart. So with the help of Saladin, an Iron Lord (one of the oldest groups of guardians that predates the city), we investigate. SIVA was created by the Bray family, a collection of golden age geniuses like no other. Imagine if Tony Stark had like 5 copies of himself. It was once under the control of Rasputin, a golden age AI called a warmind. Basically a system defense network for Sol (who completely got his shit pushed in during the collapse). When the iron lords got too close, it unleashed SIVA on them and killed all but Saladin and one other, so he’s got some issues there.

Anyways the fallen control it now, and we blow up the replication chambers to stop them making more of it, then go into an old facility for our next raid Wrath of the Machine and kill the leaders of this movement.


## GLOSSARY
Let’s take a moment to make a good glossary of terms and characters before we get too far

**The Traveler**: the big white ball above the city. Source of your Light powers, seemingly benevolent.

**Ghosts**: drones created by the Traveler. Your link to eternal life and power. They each have their own distinct personality. Some sound make. Some sound female. Some have proper names and others are just called Ghost (yours is just called Ghost, sadly haha)

**The Last City**: the last safe city on earth, under the traveler.

**The Tower**: Guardian home and command within the city.

**The Vanguard**: the three leading members of the Guardians, and largely humanity. Comprised of a representative of each of the primary Guardian class disciplines (Titan, Warlock, Hunter)

**Commander Zavala**: Titan Vanguard. Defacto leader. Handles strike operations and defense. He is the bald blue awoken man in armor.

**Ikora Rey**: Warlock Vanguard. Handles intelligence and city details. Black woman with shaved head, wears a robe.

**Cayde-6**: Hunter Vanguard. Deceased as of the events of Forsaken. Was an Exo (basically a robot). You can still hear his voice on the occasional piece of strike dialogue, as those strikes are set at a specific point in time when he was still alive. No replacement hunter vanguard has yet been named.

**Humans**: You know what these are.

**Awoken**: during the collapse, a group of human colonists on the edge of the system were caught on their ship in a shockwave between the forces of Light and Dark. This fundamentally changed them and shoved them in a time dilated pocket dimension. Eventually, led by Mara Sov, some of them returned here to help humanity against the struggles we face, while most remained in their idyllic world.

**Exo**: during the Golden Age, Clovis Bray (founder of Braytech, and head of the Bray family) found a way to transfer the human mind into an ageless machine body. It was not flawless however, as the human mine doesn’t quite want to existing on synthetic hardware. They are equipped with human functions such as the ability to sleep, eat, feel, with full anatomical accuracy. So if something goes wrong, it can trigger a reset where an Exo loses some or all of their memories and resets their brain to a more stable state. Whenever this happens, a number is appended to their name. For example Bob-1 has never been reset. But Bob-6 has been reset 5 times. Too many resets can have a negative effect on memory in general, as evidenced by the “basically has Alzheimer’s” tower gunsmith Banshee-44. Becoming a Guardian fixes these issues, and no light bearing Exo have been noted to suffer from either resets, or from poor memory as a result of a high reset count before their resurrection.

**Humanity**: an umbrella term comprising Humans, Awoken, and Exo.

**Guardian**: the magic warriors you play as. It should be noted that there is zero practical difference in a gameplay sense of playing male or female, or any of the 3 races.

**Fallen/Eliksni**: a race of 4 armed scavengers who are brilliant with technology. A long time ago, they were one of the chosen by the Traveler too. It when their collapse came and the darkness followed the traveler, it abandoned them to their death. They have never forgiven it, and they followed it across space trying to reclaim it, leaving their dead world behind. They blame us for “stealing” the “Great Machine” and most hate us as a result. They require a rare resource called Ether to grow and be healthy, and they don’t have enough. This led to rationing and starving, and a system of ritual punishment called docking. Docking 2 of the victims lower arms and placing inhibitors around the stumps ensures they won’t grow and waste resources. So any “Dreg” you see in game is shitty and starving. Their proper size is supposed to be what the game calls “Captains”. Recent events have brought forward a faction of the Eliksni who wish to work with us and serve the Great Machine.

**Variks**: an Eliksni scribe who wants to return his woolen to the old ways before their exile forced this current barbaric state.

**Misraaks/Mithrax**: Kell of House Light, cooperating with humanity for the good of the traveler.

**Vex**: robots with a glowing red eye, full of white radiolaria (this is actually them). They are a time traveling hive mind, with the primary goal of transforming the universe into more of themselves. Thinking machines. They’ve even turned entire planets into Vex computers. They were created long ago by the Dark in a previous version of our universe, to showcase what might be an ideal life form. They escaped the destruction of that reality and now live in ours, attempting to carry their goal. A splinter faction of Vex actively worships the Dark as their creator. Being a hive mind, there are no notable individual Vex personalities, though there have been a few important ones through the years.

**Hive**: three eyed ancient aliens from far away somewhere. They use magic to enact their goals and wish to fight and kill everything in the universe until only 1 species is left. They believe it is their duty to reveal this Final Shape even if it isn’t them. They weren’t always like this however. Long ago they were weak and pitiful. Short lived, perhaps a decade or so. Their planet was threatened by a solar system alignment which would have caused massive tidal waves and ripped apart their planet, killing them all, so they turned to the aid of buried Worm Gods to give them the knowledge and strength to save themselves. In exchange for this magic and knowledge, the Worm Gods offered a bargain. The Hive (Krill at the time) would take the Worm’s larva into their body as hosts, providing nourishment for the parasites. But they had been tricked. The parasites have them power and strength and immortality, but if they ever stopped fighting, stopped killing, stopped being true to its nature, the worm would grow too hungry and devour them inside out. So they had to keep killing and conquering forever, or die. Certain parties in the Hive resent this and want to be free of this bargain.

**Crota**: minor hive God, son of Oryx, died in D1.

**Oryx**: Major Hive God, one of 3 sisters who discovered the worm gods. Menaced the system with Taken, was a true believer in their faith system (Sword Logic). Dead in D1.

**Savathûn**: Major Hive God, one of 3 sisters. She is the crafty and deceitful one, and she and her brood want out of the worm bargain. She opposes the Dark and the eventual end of the universe, but she’s probably still evil. Has been behind a LOT of plots we’ve foiled through the years. Next expansion in a few weeks focuses on her.

**Xivu Arath**: Major Hive God of War. The 3rd sister. Still alive but not present yet. Is working with the Darkness to kill Savathûn and us. Currently controls the Taken as well.

**The Taken**: the black starry palette swapped enemies who act all twitchy. They don’t have personality or goals. They are tools in service to their master. Pretty much just evil ghosts. (A few exceptions were not fully Taken and therefore retained a large amount of free Will)

**The Cabal**: a military star-faring empire comprised of many races together. Their combat forces are comprised of “Cabal” the first race who are big and chunky but somewhat human shaped. They come from a high pressure world, and so wear pressurized suits to keep themselves from exploding. They also keep war beasts (basically space dogs). And Psions, a small lithe psychic species with genetic memory. Psions have traditionally been slaves/client races, but have been freed on 2 occasions (the current one seems to stick). They were a minor footnote in D1, as they were merely a scout legion or two. But they start off D2 with a bang.

**Emperor Calus**: Was a hedonistic emperor before the events of the game. Beloved by the people, he was overthrown in a military coup and exiled. He’s a dumbass but we love him.

**Dominus Ghaul**: the dude who wrecks our shit in D2, and who overthrew Calus.

**Empress Caiatl**: Daughter of Calus. Assumed the throne after Ghaul’s death. She’s a healthy middle ground between the lavishness of Calus, and the hard military strength of Ghaul. Currently allied with us.

**The Scorn**: basically zombie fallen. They are controlled by the Darkness currently.

## DESTINY 2
Ok Destiny 2 time

### THE RED WAR

After our successes in Destiny 1, the city is riding high and feeling safe for once. But the Cabal legion from the first game sent word back to the main empire about the events that transpired, and they realized there was an incredible resource they could use: The Light.

The Red Legion, largest fighting force in the Cabal, arrive in force in our system in a devastating first strike on the city, destroying the tower and Cage the traveler with advanced technology, severing our connection to the light. They are led by Ghaul, defacto leader of the empire after a military coup. This leads to the permanent death of many guardians. The remaining guardians scatter across the system, and do what they can to survive. Your character receives a vision from the Traveler and you are guided to an old shard of its outer shell in the wastes of the European dead zone. Using this piece of the Traveler, you reestablish your connection to the Light and embark on a quest to defeat the Legion. You travel across the system and reunite the scattered lightless Vanguard alongside some mortals, and concoct a plan to save the Traveler. Meanwhile, Ghaul attempts to convince the Traveler he is worthy of the Light. Long story short, you sneak back into the city and try to disable the shield around the Traveler but are met by Ghaul, who has abandoned being chosen by the Traveler and resorts to siphoning the Light directly. You defeat him despite his powers, but he rises as a gigantic Light Monster. But before he can kill you, the Traveler senses the great danger and wakes, breaking free or the cage and destroying Ghaul once and for all.

You and the Vanguard set to rebuilding and getting things back in order in a new tower… but we are treated to an end credit scene of the Traveler waking up (when he destroyed Ghaul) from a different perspective. The energy wave passes through the solar system and into dark space, where it washes over a fleet of black Pyramid ships, awakening them as they start to head to our system. Shortly after Ghaul’s defeat, we are introduced to former Emperor Calus, who is SUPER impressed we killed the guys who overthrew him. He hosts a series of games aboard his Grand planet eating Leviathan, which is the content of our first D2 raid “Leviathan”.

### THE CURSE OF OSIRIS

Ikora is alerted to the reappearance of Osiris (a legendary guardian and her mentor), or more specifically his Ghost Sagira. She has been found damaged, and we repair her to find him. Osiris has been living inside the Vex gate network for… a long time after he was exiled from the city for dangerous research. But he believes he has uncovered a plot by the Vex that could some day render them victorious in snuffing out all Light and Dark. Ultimately we destroy the vex mind responsible for this on Mercury, and Osiris pledges to not be such a recluse. In this content we also learn his regret for the death of Saint-14, another legendary guardian who chased him to bring him home (they were/are lovers).

Gonna be real with you; this DLC sucked hard. But the raid features you boarding the Leviathan to unclog its intake after it swallowed a massive Vex mind from the planet it was eating.

### WARMIND

Legendary hunter Ana Bray (one of the few guardians who learned about her former life) has gone to Mars to reawaken Rasputin the warmind (his core is housed on Mars) and ask for his help against the darkness. We aid her and discover a brood of Hive led by Oryx’s exiled son who isn’t dead (Nokris) and an outcast Worm God. Nokris was excommunicated because he practices necromancy, something horrible to the Hive. Their Sword Logic dictates that if a thing could not keep itself alive, it would be wrong to return it to life. Anyways you convince RSPN to help, and use his advanced golden age tech to beat the shit out of Xôl the Worm God and banish it (but not fully kill it). RSPN then gives a cool Russian speech (he only speaks distorted Russian) about how he’s gonna help on HIS terms, and then launches thousands of weapons satellites into the system.

RSPN is super cool.

This raid is about the ranking officer of the Red Legion leading what’s left of the fleet to board and try to commandeer the Leviathan, believing it to be able to turn the tide of the war. We show up and put down the boarders, and use the advanced weapons systems to blow the fleet from the sky.

### FORSAKEN

A prison riot has occurred at the Prison of Elders in the reef (the place where Variks keeps criminals to be tried and sentenced in ancient combat). You accompany Cayde-6 to the prison to put it down as a favor to Petra Venge (acting regent of the Reef), but things go sideways. You discover the existence of the Scorn, reanimated Fallen being led by an unkillable Scorn called the Fanatic (he comes back to life no matter how many times he dies) and a “apparently he got put in prison” Uldren Sov. The scorn escape, as does Uldren, but not before they kill Cayde’s ghost, and then him.

Your guardian goes on a bloody path of revenge across the Tangled Shore (a series of asteroids) against the wishes of the vanguard, systematically killing each of the scorn leaders and coming face to face with Uldren.

Uldren has been acting all this time at the behest of a being he believes to be his sister Mara, trapped behind a magical gateway rather than being dead. But even though he succeeds in opening the gate, it is revealed that the vision in his mind was an illusion, a manipulation by Riven of a Thousand Voices, the last living Ahamkara kept prisoner by the late Queen Mara. Uldren is executed by your guardian and Petra.

(Ahamkara are literal magical Wish granting creatures that feed off of desire and wishes, usually twisting them in the worst possible way. They are also unique among the lore of the game because their consciousness lives on in their bones, along with some of their power, even after death. And they are also aware that they live in a video game, bizarrely enough)

The raid is called Last Wish, and you venture into the Dreaming City, one of the true homes of the Awoken. A city of stone and crystal and magic. This is where Riven is trapped. She controls an army of Taken but you manage to get through them and slay her. But doing so unleashes a curse upon the Dreaming City. It’s forever trapped in a repeating 3 week time loop as a result. It is also revealed that Savathûn was behind Riven’s manipulations.

### THE BLACK ARMORY (season)

You learn of an organization (really just one Exo) that makes high end guns. You work with this Exo (Ada-1) to recover her forges and life’s work, and have her make guns for Guardians.

The raid introduced here is Scourge of the Past, and features you gunning through an abandoned part of the last city which got destroyed in the Red War, fighting the group of Fallen who stole the black armory technology. The final boss is basically a Fallen Metal Gear though, so that’s pretty sweet.

### JOKER’S WILD (season)

OK I forgot to mention in Forsaken we got a new game mode called Gambit, overseen by a sketchy dude named the Drifter. You kill enemies in teams and deposit notes or darkness into a bank for him and kill a boss. What does he do with these motes? Who knows. Anyways this season gave us a new version of Gambit and an activity set in the IX realms about farming better gambit armor. (The IX are consciousnesses seeded from the planets in our solar system, and exert power over the system through dark energy manipulation. They mostly do want to protect life, since they believe if it dies, they die too. They’re pretty unknowable)

### SEASON OF OPULENCE

Emperor Calus continues to try and buy our affection and devotion yet again, offering more games and prizes aboard the Leviathan. We learn that he believes the Darkness will kill the universe, and he was really depressed about it for a long time. But mostly depressed about his dethronement. Because if he wasn’t the Emperor, was he still special? Did he matter? But during his exile as his ship drifted through dark space, he encountered the Darkness/Entity/pyramid ships/nobody knows but it was probably evil. This encounter changed him on a fundamental level, and is probably slowly killing him. But he believes now that his destiny is to be the last living thing, and wants you to keep him safe until then. He believes it’ll bring meaning to his life. He also has his scribes write fan fiction about us and how we are totally gonna join him and kill all our friends and our ghost, and keep him safe until we are the last two things in existence and he kills us tenderly before dying himself.

So that’s cool.

The raid this time is Crown of Sorrow, and basically Calus found a crown made by Savathûn which could allegedly control Hive, so he put it on one of his soldiers to test it. But surprise it actually put the soldier under Savathûn’s control and Hive start causing a ruckus in his ship’s basement. So yet again we go clean up his mess. Savathûn and Calus have an apparently longstanding resentment for the other.

### SHADOWKEEP

Eris Morn is back on the moon and is investigating some spoopy shit. There’s another brood of Hive trying to find favorite with the Darkness, and we discover a pyramid ship buried beneath the lunar surface, from ancient times. It speaks to us and gives us visions, telling us it isn’t going to hurt us. It’s going to save us. The raid is us following a signal from the Pyramid ship to the Black Garden, where we kill a bunch of Vex to prove we can cooperate.

Yeah it’s really short.

### SEASON OF THE UNDYING (same time as Shadowkeep)

Vex from the Black Garden are invading across the system under the leadership of the Undying Mind. We hatch a plan to kill it millions of times across multiple timelines to make sure it can’t come back. We do so.

### SEASON OF DAWN

Osiris tried to make a time machine to go back and save Saint-14 but failed, so he hid that machine away. But the Red Legion found it and are trying to rewrite history so that they won the war. We kill them… but most importantly, we travel back in time, meet Saint-14 and inspire him to become legendary, and then pull him out of his death by stopping the Vex from killing him.

So we bring a Badass Gay Russian Robot back to life.

### SEASON OF THE WORTHY

The Red Legion (they just don’t quit) have launched the Almighty at us on a crash course for Earth. (I forgot to mention. The Almighty is basically a Death Star which explodes a system’s sun. It was a threat we disabled during the red war). Unable to change course, the vanguard turns to Rasputin for help. Over the course of the season we build more warsats, fortify his control over launch sites and old networks, and pump him up to apocalyptic levels. We also learn he regrets killing the Iron Lords so long ago.

At the end of the season RSPN blows the Almighty into tiny pieces and saves us all, and everybody is super optimistic about our odds now against the NEARLY HERE fleet of Pyramid ships.

### SEASON OF ARRIVALS

lmao Rasputin tries to shoot the fleet as they arrive and gets instantly bodied, and basically deleted. Ana Bray saves all of him that she can on a fancy flash drive and starts uploading him into an Exo body (still hasn’t happened).

The Pyramids just sorta… chill and hang out. But they are trying to communicate to us, and Savathûn’s forces attempt to stop it taking place. She doesn’t want us chatting and growing closer with them. Why? Unclear. But we do know that Savathûn no longer follows the Darkness or worships the sword logic. She wants out.

### BEYOND LIGHT

Alright so the Pyramids DID do something and now several planets have just straight up gotten disappeared from our solar system, replaced by weird gravitational anomalies. During investigations we receive a signal from Variks on Europa. A new leader (Eramis) has risen amongst the Eliksni and is gathering the houses together, but they follow the Pyramids, and are developing the ability to use Darkness themselves in the form of Stasis (magic ice basically). Using the help of the Exo Stranger who has returned, as well as Variks, we take apart her House apart and stop more stasis use, but only by embracing that power and learning to use it ourselves. We also learn a lot about Clovis Bray and Braytech and the family and that the Exo Stranger is in fact Elsie Bray from another timeline. We also discover that our tower gunsmith Banshee-44 is Clovis Bray, but he reset himself so many times on purpose that he forgot who he used to be (a complete amoral scientific dickhead obsessed with living forever). Rifts in the tower begin to form over the use of Darkness spreading through the ranks.

The raid is called Deep Stone Crypt, and takes place in the Exo factory on Europa where the fallen are attempting to create Fallen Exo as well as bring an old enemy (Taniks) back to life. Again. They succeed on both fronts, and we chase them to a space station and crash it int the surface of Europa, killing them.

### SEASON OF THE HUNT (same time as Beyond Light)

Strange Hive artifacts have been popping up across the system, seemingly eroding the will of our enemies and enraging them. Osiris investigates, but he is drawn into a trap and is nearly killed. His ghost, Sagira, dies and renders Osiris mortal and powerless once again. We attempt to rescue him but are best to the punch by a risen Uldren Sov, who now has a ghost, the light, and no idea about who he used to be or what he did. We refrain from telling him, at Osiris’ specific request. We work with Osiris and Crow (Uldren’s new name) to rid the system of these artifacts and the “wrathborn” they create in service of Xivu Arath, who is slowly making pushes into the system. At the end of the season we free Crow from indentured servitude to a fallen crime boss, and encourage him to come to the tower and be a guardian.

### SEASON OF THE CHOSEN

A new Cabal fleet arrives, helmed by Empress Caiatl. We learn that the Cabal have been at war with the Hive a long time, but the Hive, led by Xivu Arath, have destroyed the Cabal homeworld. What is left of the empire is now concentrated in and around Sol as refugees. Empress Caiatl asks us to join her empire as vassals and take the fight to the Hive. We refuse. So she sets up a series of ritual combat to recruit members for a war council. We disrupt them and claim all the glory for ourselves. Crow, Osiris and Saladin act as our leads this season, each having their own opinion on our enemy and whether we can have peace. Eventually it comes to a head and Caiatl offers us a winner take all combat against her champion. We win? We get freedom and an armistice. They win? We join her empire willingly.

Naturally we win. But at the armistice, Zavala is nearly assassinated by a rogue Psion and Crow saves his life, revealing his face to Zavala… who also doesn’t tell him who he used to be, but welcomes him as a brother in the light.

No raid, but we get a nice secret mission aboard a ruined Cabal cruiser where Calus was experimenting with Scorn. Long story short, he hooked the Scorn up to the Crown of sorrow to form a hive mind to speak with the darkness and demand answers as to why it wouldn’t speak to him. But it went horribly wrong and now the Emperor and Leviathan are missing, maybe sucked into space hell, maybe not, and now the Scorn are under the direct control of “The Voice in the Dark” whoever that is. Osiris takes the crown for further study

### SEASON OF THE SPLICER

The Vex have somehow trapped the City in a simulation of eternal night, and are stealing our energy and turning the civilian’s moods dark. Unable to solve it ourselves, we turn to Mithrax, Kell of the House of Light. Newly formed, this Eliksni house is home to those who wish an end to the endless fighting and still worship the Traveler (or Great Machine as they call it). Mithrax is a Splicer, an Eliksni with technological and mechanical aptitude far beyond even their own advanced race’s normal understanding. In exchange for his help in ending the cursed night, we offer his house a home in the city (admittedly a bombed out shit hole part of the city. But still). Through the season he helps us traverse the Vex digital realm, slowly uncovering that the Vex in charge of this is Quria, a Taken Vex working for Savathûn (Quria is also the reason Savathûn controls the Taken). While we work on solving this, one of the political leaders of the city with access to vex technology (an Exo named Lakshmi-2) starts getting very xenophobic, and inflames racial tensions against the new Eliksni allies. We ultimately defeat Quria, but Lakshmi will not be deterred, and opens a Vex gate inside the Eliksni quarter of the city to try and get them to do a good old fashioned ethnic cleansing. She gets shot by a vex and dies as she lived: an idiot. We repel the invasion with the help of Mithrax and Saint-14 (who spends all season slowly getting less racist against the Eliksni) while Osiris disappears suspiciously in the confusion. The Endless Night is no more.

The raid here is a reprised Vault of Glass from Destiny 1. It has no further plot significance, it didn’t “happen a second time”. They just added it in as a mid year freebie.

### SEASON OF THE LOST (you are here)

It is revealed that Queen Mara is alive and well, and had died on purpose against Oryx to try and steal some of his power years ago (we learned this a while back, forgot to mention). But she has finally managed to come back to our reality, and has a bargain she needs our help with. She takes us to the Dreaming City where we meet Osiris, who is a wanted man for his potential role in the Vex issue last season… but lo and behold Osiris transforms into a frozen crystal of Savathûn. This entire year, ever since losing his ghost, Osiris has been possessed and controlled by Savathûn, manipulating us and stealing pieces for her plans. The deal is this: Help Savathûn and get back Osiris. What does she want? To be free of her worm (which is slowly eating her inside out because it’s grown too hungry) and to be protected against her sister Xivu arath who is hunting her down for heresy. She is encased in crystal to slow the effects of the worm as she waits for us to fix it. So we help Mara gather her Techeuns (awoken witches) to perform a magical exorcism and remove the worm from her body. We are currently waiting on an astral alignment for the exorcism to be possible (likely next week).

Mara plans to kill Savathûn after she becomes mortal. The fact that the entire next expansion dropping on February 22nd is dedicated to Savathûn would seem to indicate that won’t fucking work lol

Savathûn also spends the season chatting with us, trying to make herself seem like a good guy, casting doubt on our motives and capabilities. She also alludes to a greater power in the darkness she opposes. It is LIKELY she will remain a villain or at best an anti hero, but she is opposed to the same ultimate bad guy that we are as well.
